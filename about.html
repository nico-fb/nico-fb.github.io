                      I am a student at Brown University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Statistics. I'm looking to gain experience coding in different languages, develop skills to analyze big data, and seek opportunities to apply my analytical and critical thinking skills.

                      <br><br>

                      In my spare time, I enjoy practicing the saxophone, working on puzzle hunts, and playing basketball. Being from Argentina and having the opportunity to live in Spain, Taiwan, and the United States has also helped me be more culturally diverse and influenced how I live.

            <p>I am currently working closely with other software developers in a collaborative environment to develop, prototype, and release cutting-edge AI software. My contributions so far include debugging and finalizing a website/Twitter blog that scrapes RSS feeds and summarizes government news from various sources, utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas and Requests, as well as APIs including Tweepy, OpenAI, Ujeebu, and TLDRThis. I independently developed a web scraper for a client that uses the Asyncio, Pyppeteer, and Beautiful Soup libraries to extract high school sports scores from dynamic web pages, providing accurate and up-to-date results for any specified date. This scraper is triggered from a Discord bot I also created so that the client can retrieve scores remotely whenever they want, and receive an email with all the updated scores from that day. I am also taking the lead in the design phase of a Kivy app that helps clients to generate, rate, and combine article headlines effortlessly, ultimately delivering a customized solution that meets their specific preferences.</p>
